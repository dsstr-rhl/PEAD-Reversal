# PEAD-Reversal

The algos only run on Quantopian IDE. Copy and paste an algorithm in the Quantopian algorithm IDE, select start, end date for the backtest and initial dollar amount options in the IDE and run the backtest.

Desclaimer: This code was designed with Quantopian guidelines in mind. Quantopian environment periodically evolves, which means at some time in future bugs might develop into the code.
